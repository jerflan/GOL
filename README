The purpose of this repo is to show my journey in trying to design and build the Game of Life of John Horton Conway fame in a simple ruby environment.

So far I've concluded that I need to design the game based a 2d array that houses the actions in the code. 

We'll call this 2d array the "grid." As per the assignment, the size of this grid will be based on standard user input.

Within this grid, there will be an initial colony, a randomly generated 3x3 square.

Each square of the colony will have a value of either dead (0) or alive ("a")

The program assesses the value of each cell in the colony and determines whether or not the primary_cell will live into the next generation based on the following rules:
	1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
	2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
	3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
	4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
