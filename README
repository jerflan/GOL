README

The purpose of this repo is to show my journey in trying to design and build the Game of Life of John Horton Conway fame in a simple ruby environment.

So far I've concluded that I need to design the game based a 2d array that houses the actions in the code. 

We'll call this 2d array the "grid." As per the assignment, the size of this grid will be based on standard user input.

Within this grid, there will be an initial colony, a randomly generated 3x3 square.

Each square of the colony will have a value of either "dead" or "alive."
